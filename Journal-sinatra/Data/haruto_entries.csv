"October 5, 2020","Today, I woke up very early. I ate a sandwich with ham, and yogurt. It was good. When I got to school, there was nobody there. First I answered some quick maths, and it was fun. Next, I wrote some kanji. Today's kanji was difficult. After writing kanji, it was breaktime. Break time was fun because I played with my friends. After break time, I sang 'Mickey Mouse'. After that, I went home. First, I played with my mommy. After that I played with Lego Mario. I think I want to buy more Lego Mario. Later, I will play soccer. After soccer, I will buy something from Lawson."
